## Development Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies

1. Monorepo Setup → Core Agent Types → Memory System
2. Core Agent Types → Tool Registry → Agent Services
3. Agent Services → Workflow Orchestration → Next.js Integration
4. UI Components → Next.js Integration → User Feedback

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test each package in isolation
- Verify tool registration and execution
- Validate workflow execution with mocked dependencies
- Test memory operations with mocked Redis

### Integration Testing

- Test interactions between packages
- Verify workflow execution with actual services
- Test service interactions with actual tools
- Validate memory persistence with actual Redis instances

### End-to-End Testing

- Test the complete agent lifecycle
- Validate UI interactions with the agent system
- Test WebSocket communication for real-time updates
- Verify error handling and recovery

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Token Budget Overruns**

   - Implement dynamic token counting
   - Add automatic context pruning
   - Create fallback modes for complex requests

2. **Performance Issues**

   - Add response time monitoring
   - Implement Redis caching for common operations
   - Create progressive loading for complex plans

3. **Integration Challenges**

   - Start with minimal integration points
   - Add comprehensive integration tests
   - Create fallback modes for component failures

4. **Serverless Function Timeouts**

   - Use Upstash Workflow for long-running operations
   - Implement QStash for reliable message delivery with retries
   - Create step-based execution to fit within serverless constraints

5. **Distributed System Complexity**
   - Start with simpler workflows and gradually add complexity
   - Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
   - Add circuit breakers for failure isolation

## Conclusion

This roadmap outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing agentic AI capabilities using Upstash technologies within a monorepo architecture. The distributed architecture with Upstash Workflow, QStash, and Redis enables robust, reliable agent execution that overcomes the limitations of serverless environments, while the monorepo structure facilitates code sharing and maintenance across packages.
